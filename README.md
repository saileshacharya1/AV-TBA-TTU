This repository consists of the data, scripts, and outcomes related to the project that analyzes the preferences for several travel-based activities (TBAs) and the evaluation of travel time usefulness (TTU) in the autonomous vehicle (AV) travel compared to the current human-driven vehicle (HV) travel. Several probit models are fitted to understand the underlying mechanisms behind this process. The description of the contents of each folder in this repository is presented below:

1. data: This folder consists of the data necessary for this project. The raw data used is not presented here because of the lack of permission to make the data publicly available. However, the detailed documentation of the data, in addition to the questionnaire implemented to collect the data, is available in this folder. Note that not all variables in the data (or documentation or questionnaire) have been used in this project.

2. scripts: All the analysis scripts written for this project are presented in this folder. At present, all scripts have been written in R.

3. outputs: This folder consists of the results of the analyses performed. There are two subfolders: models and plots. Outputs of all the analytical models are presented in the models folder whereas the figures and plots developed for the paper (resulting from this analysis) are available in the plots folder. Just so you know, all outputs and plots have not been presented in the final paper.
